# Purity

Usually discussed in terms of `functional purity`, but also available to `object`s, `expression`s, and `procedure`s,
purity is an important characteristic for code that can make certain code easier to reason about, to safely test, 
parallelize, which can lower the amount of work to test, make more code more composable, and in many cases help keep 
code shorter and easier to understand.

***Purity is important***.

Let's go over why.

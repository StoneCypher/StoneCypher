# On "fast" websites

Developers often focus on a single major topic

This document discusses John's belief on how best to approach these to afford a web application that customers are left
noticing performance differences in, by contrast to their other apps.



## Hedging

This document is to be understood as a document of opinion.  If something isn't directly cited, please understand it to
be something John believes.  The document will be written in tone of fact, because if everything in here is manually
hedged "I believe" or whatever, the document will triple in length and become unreadable.  ***Please allow this
paragraph to serve as proxy humility for the entire document; thanks***.

To that end, please also understand that I openly invite suggestions, recommendations, and rewrites.  Please submit them
on Github if you know how, in the hope of keeping things simple.
